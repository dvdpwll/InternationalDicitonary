# InternationalDicitonary
Promt:
Your task in this project is to create a German-English, English-German, French-English, English-French, Latin-English, English-Latin, Hebrew-English, and English-Hebrew international dictionary. You will be responible for entering a total of 25 words in each language, the part of speech each word represents and its English meaning. You will write a menu-driven program.

I used C++ to write this program, this is a text based menu, runs in the command prompt.
